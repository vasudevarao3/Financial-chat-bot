We, therefore, additionally report the revenue growth in constant currency terms, which represents the real growth in revenue excluding the impact of currency fluctuations. We calculate constant currency growth by comparing current period revenues in respective local currencies converted to INR using prior‐period exchange rates and comparing the same to our prior‐period reported revenues. Our revenues in reported currency terms for fiscal 2021 is US$ 13,561 million, a growth of 6.1%. Our revenues for fiscal 2021 in constant currency grew by 5%.\\n\\nWe added 475 new customers (gross) during fiscal 2021 as compared to 376 new customers (gross) during fiscal 2020. For fiscals 2021 and 2020, 96.2% and 97.5%, respectively, of our revenues came from repeat business, which we define as revenues from a client that also contributed to our revenues during the prior fiscal.\\n\\nOn a consolidated basis, for the year ended March 31, 2021, approximately 97.1% were export revenues whereas 2.9% were domestic revenues, while for the year ended March 31, 2020, 97.4% were export revenues whereas 2.6% were domestic revenues.\\nIn doing so, the Company first evaluates whether it controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer. The Company considers whether it has the primary obligation to fulfil the contract, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the goods or service and therefore is acting as a principal or an agent.\\n\\nThe incremental costs of obtaining a contract (i.e., costs that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained) are recognized as an asset if the Company expects to recover them.\\n\\nCertain eligible, nonrecurring costs (e.g. set-up or transition or transformation costs) that do not represent a separate performance obligation are recognized as an asset when such costs (a) relate directly to the contract; (b) generate or enhance resources of the Company that will be used in satisfying the performance obligation in the future; and (c) are expected to be recovered.\\n\\nCapitalized contract costs relating to upfront payments to customers are amortized to revenue and other capitalized costs are amortized to expenses over the respective contract life on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or services to customer to which the asset relates. Capitalized costs are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when present value of projected remaining operating cash flows is not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the capitalized costs.\\n\\nThe Company presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n\\n# Revenue from operations for the year ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 is as follows :\\n\\n|Particulars|Year ended March 31, 2022|Year ended March 31, 2021|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Revenue from software services|103,615|85,669|\\n|Revenue from products and platforms|325|243|\\n|Total revenue from operations|103,940|85,912|\\n\\n236\\n\\nInfosys Integrated Annual Report 2021-22\\n\\n\\n            ### User Query:\\n            What was Infosys' revenue in 2023 according to historical data?\\n\\n            ### Guidelines for Answer:\\n            1.

We, therefore, additionally report the revenue growth in constant currency terms, which represents the real growth in revenue excluding the impact of currency fluctuations. We calculate constant currency growth by comparing current period revenues in respective local currencies converted to INR using prior‐period exchange rates and comparing the same to our prior‐period reported revenues. Our revenues in reported currency terms for fiscal 2021 is US$ 13,561 million, a growth of 6.1%. Our revenues for fiscal 2021 in constant currency grew by 5%.\\n\\nWe added 475 new customers (gross) during fiscal 2021 as compared to 376 new customers (gross) during fiscal 2020. For fiscals 2021 and 2020, 96.2% and 97.5%, respectively, of our revenues came from repeat business, which we define as revenues from a client that also contributed to our revenues during the prior fiscal.\\n\\nOn a consolidated basis, for the year ended March 31, 2021, approximately 97.1% were export revenues whereas 2.9% were domestic revenues, while for the year ended March 31, 2020, 97.4% were export revenues whereas 2.6% were domestic revenues.\\nIn doing so, the Company first evaluates whether it controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer. The Company considers whether it has the primary obligation to fulfil the contract, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the goods or service and therefore is acting as a principal or an agent.\\n\\nThe incremental costs of obtaining a contract (i.e., costs that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained) are recognized as an asset if the Company expects to recover them.\\n\\nCertain eligible, nonrecurring costs (e.g. set-up or transition or transformation costs) that do not represent a separate performance obligation are recognized as an asset when such costs (a) relate directly to the contract; (b) generate or enhance resources of the Company that will be used in satisfying the performance obligation in the future; and (c) are expected to be recovered.\\n\\nCapitalized contract costs relating to upfront payments to customers are amortized to revenue and other capitalized costs are amortized to expenses over the respective contract life on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or services to customer to which the asset relates. Capitalized costs are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when present value of projected remaining operating cash flows is not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the capitalized costs.\\n\\nThe Company presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n\\n# Revenue from operations for the year ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 is as follows :\\n\\n|Particulars|Year ended March 31, 2022|Year ended March 31, 2021|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Revenue from software services|103,615|85,669|\\n|Revenue from products and platforms|325|243|\\n|Total revenue from operations|103,940|85,912|\\n\\n236\\n\\nInfosys Integrated Annual Report 2021-22\\n\\n\\n            ### User Query:\\n            What was Infosys' revenue in 2023 according to historical data?\\n\\n            ### Guidelines for Answer:\\n            1.
